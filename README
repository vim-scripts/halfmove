Vim script to move the cursor half way down/up the screen. This can be
thought of as a binary search for a line that is visible in the window by
either moving up or down.

Usage:
  Press <C-K> to jump half way to the top of the screen
  Press <C-J> to jump half way to the bottom of the screen
  Pressing <C-[KJ]> several times in a row will jump halfway to the
  top/bottom or half way to a previous jump location.
  Example: To jump 3/8 of the way to the bottom of the screen press
    <C-J><C-K><C-J>
  
Customization:
  map <silent> <YOUR-DOWN-KEY> :call HM_Move("down")<CR>
  map <silent> <YOUR-UP-KEY>   :call HM_Move("up")<CR>

Problems:
  <C-J> and <C-K> will not be mapped over existing mappings. If other
  scripts map <C-J> or <C-K> then you will need to manually override those.
